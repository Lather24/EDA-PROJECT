# EDA-PROJECT
# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Zomato dataset to derive meaningful insights about restaurant trends, customer preferences, and dining habits. The analysis was conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries. The goal was to uncover patterns in the dataset and present actionable insights to aid decision-making.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Understanding the structure and content of the Zomato dataset.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- Exploring the dataset to find trends and patterns in restaurant ratings, cuisines, and locations.
- Visualizing insights to make the data easier to interpret.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Zomato and contains information about:
- Restaurant names
- Locations
- Ratings
- Cuisines
- Average cost for two
- Operational hours
- Delivery availability
- Other relevant features

## Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.

## Key Insights
Some key insights derived from the analysis include:
1. **Popular Cuisines**: Identification of the most popular cuisines across different locations.
2. **Restaurant Ratings**: Analysis of factors influencing restaurant ratings and the distribution of ratings.
3. **Cost Analysis**: Examination of the average cost for two people across various cuisines and locations.
4. **Location Trends**: Identification of areas with the highest density of restaurants and the most highly rated locations.
5. **Delivery Insights**: Analysis of restaurants offering delivery services and their rating trends.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:
- Distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Heatmap of correlation between numerical features.
- Bar charts showing the popularity of cuisines.
- Scatter plots of average cost for two vs. ratings.
- Pie charts to illustrate restaurant type distribution.

## Challenges
- Handling missing or inconsistent data entries.
- Managing outliers in numerical data such as cost.
- Encoding categorical variables for analysis.

## Conclusion
The Zomato Data Analysis project helped uncover valuable insights about restaurant trends and customer preferences. These findings can guide restaurant owners, customers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Future Scope
Future improvements to the project could include:
- Integration of machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.
- Analysis of customer reviews to extract sentiment trends.
- Expansion of the dataset for more comprehensive insights.
